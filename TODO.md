- ~~Before attempting to bootstrap a box, check if the hostname is what you expect it to be~~
- capify
- Deployer jobs should first of all check if a VM by that name alread exists.
  Simply querying vCenter won't work if two VMs with the same name get deployed at the same time.
- resque/status_server might need some (monkey)patching. Too many params screw the layout up... 
- ~~log the "creator" somewhere! (it might be different than the "owner")~~
- Authentication on /resque/status
- Check if pool server is on a specific network?
- When looking for pool servers, check for specific attributes (vmomi.rb/find_pool_templates)
- ~~get rid of the two queues, one (with concurrent restriction) is enough~~
- ~~catch DataMapper exceptions and write the error message in the log file~~
- annotations
  - On the VCenter, annotate a VM with the creator's name
  - Annotate pool servers, and look for that information when selecting one
- ~~vmomi.rb: get VM uuid (will be stored in the IP/VLAN DB)~~
- ~~use name parameters in vmomi.rb/reconfig_vm~~
- ~~Move deployed VM to the right folder~~
- ~~Failed jobs notifications?~~ Did that only for Jobs::Deployer::VMware
- Submitting Jobs from console.rb doesn't work
